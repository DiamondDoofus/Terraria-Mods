Retaliation Mod Blueprint

1) âˆš Create method to track any damage taken by a player and its source
2) Apply some logic to damage tracking (ex. removing all data after spawn/respawn; storing damage and its source in key value pairs; track if damage should be reflected)
3) Add debug armor set that gives the retaliation buff
4) Make damage tracking only occur when a player has the retaliation buff
5) Create retaliation damage class
